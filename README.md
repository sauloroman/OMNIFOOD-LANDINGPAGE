<br />

Omnifood is a web page to buy some plans to eat better. It was developed to apply and improve my frontend skills into a real project. It has seven sections where you can find information about this start-up, and it's completely responsive.
<br />
<br />

Technologies used: 

  * HTML5
  * CSS3 ( Flexbox and CSS Grid )
  * JavaScript
<br />
<br />

You can check its functionality in:

```
<br />

On the other hand, Javascript was used to add some animation at some sections of the site, to integrate a mobile menu, to make smooth scroll and to apply some css properties in old browsers. So, you don't need a deep expertice of Javascript to understand the code.
